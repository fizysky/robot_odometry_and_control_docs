Robot odometry & control Documentation
======================================

**The Robot odometry and control** is a ROS package that can control mobile robots with 
any user define kinematics and also can calculate odometry base on  measurements of velocity 
from each wheel. :ref:`. <main>` There are three posible wheels types which can be use to create robot 
kinematics:



* Fixed 
* Sterred
* Omnidirectional
